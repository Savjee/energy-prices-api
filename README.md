# Energy Price API

Simple API that returns the price for gas and electricity. Currently only supports Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª but I'm open to pull requests!.

## Usage

Get gas prices:
```
GET https://energy-prices.savjee.workers.dev/be/gas
```

Response:
```json
{
	"price":2.3989239371241693,
	"unit":"m3"
}
```

Get electricity price:
```
GET https://energy-prices.savjee.workers.dev/be/electricity
```

Response:
```json
{
	"avg":0.3301816666666666,
	"median":0.30147
}
```

The API is a Cloudflare Worker that makes requests to the datasources (PowerNext and Elia) and caches the results for 1 hour.
